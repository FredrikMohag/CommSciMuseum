  <div class="cosmo-text"><p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.
  Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.</p>
</div>
<div class="cosmo-fun"><p> Fun fact! <br> Did you know that the largest volcano in the entire solar system isn't on Earth? It's on Mars! It's called Olympus Mons, and it's about 13.6 miles (22 kilometers) high, which is nearly three times the height of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth. Imagine climbing a mountain that's three times taller than the highest one on our planet.</p>

  <h2>Evolution</h2>
</div>
<div class="cosmo-container">
<div class="cosmo-fun"><p> Fun fact! <br> Did you know that not all dinosaurs were gigantic? While some dinosaurs, like the massive Brachiosaurus, were as tall as a four-story building, others were as small as chickens! One of the tiniest dinosaurs ever discovered is the Microraptor, about the size of a crow. So, when you think about dinosaurs, remember that they came in all sorts of shapes and sizes, just like animals today.</p>
</div>
<div class="cosmo-text"><p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
  Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

<h2 class="move-right">Biology and Medicine</h2>
</div>
<div class="cosmo-container">
  <img src="/images/biology.png" alt="index-page" class="robot-img" />
<div class="cosmo-text"><p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.
  For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.</p>
</div>
<div class="cosmo-fun"><p> Fun fact! <br>Your body is like a bustling city! It has around 37 trillion cells working together. To put that in perspective, there are more cells in your body than there are stars in our Milky Way galaxy! Each cell has its own job, like the workers in a city, and they work together to keep you healthy and alive. So, you're basically a city of cells.</p>

  <h2>Robotics and AI</h2>
</div>
<div class="cosmo-container">
  <div class="cosmo-fun"><p> Fun fact! <br> Robots can be really smart, but did you know that some robots are inspired by animals? Scientists and engineers study animals like cheetahs and birds to make robots that can move and adapt like them. For example, there's a robot called 'RoboBee' that's as small as a paperclip and can fly like a real bee. Nature can be a great teacher for making cool robots.</p>
  </div>
<div class="cosmo-text"><p>The information revolution is here, with robotics and artificial intelligence leading the way into the future. From AI's practical home applications to the industrial uses of robotics, the future is unfolding before us. You can even greet and shake hands with Rob the Robot, a glimpse of the technological marvels that await.</p>

<h2 class="move-right">Ecology</h2>
</div>
<div class="cosmo-container">
  <img src="/images/ecology.png" alt="index-page" class="robot-img" />
<div class="cosmo-text"><p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.
  In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.</p>
</div>
<div class="cosmo-fun"><p> Fun fact! <br> Did you know that more and more people are coming up with cool ideas to help fight global warming? Some scientists are working on creating 'solar paint' that can turn walls and buildings into solar panels, so we can use clean energy from the sun to power our homes. Others are designing 'green roofs' covered in plants to keep buildings cool and absorb carbon dioxide. People all around the world are using their creativity to find solutions to make our planet healthier and cooler.</p>
